I often switch between fixing code and taking photos with my camera. At first, these activities may seem very different—one is logical, the other artistic. But over time, I’ve seen how closely connected they really are.

## The Intersection of Code and Creativity

In web development and data analysis, structure and logic are very important. But when you add design, the code becomes something people enjoy using. For example, when I worked on a data visualization project, I used ideas like balance and contrast—things I learned from photography. It made the design easier to understand and nicer to look at.

## Photography: A Lens for Design Thinking

Photography has helped me see composition, color, and storytelling better—skills I now use in digital design. Taking photos teaches me how to make strong visuals. This helps me when I design layouts, choose colors, and think about how people will use my projects.

## Bridging Disciplines Through Projects

## Embracing the Synergy

Combining tech and art isn’t about keeping them separate. It’s about letting them work together. This way, I can solve problems in a smarter and more creative way. It helps me build things that not only work well but also feel right to the people using them.

By growing both my technical and creative sides, I keep learning and improving as a creative technologist. I find new ideas where code and creativity meet.
